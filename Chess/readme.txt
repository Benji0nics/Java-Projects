#Chess
This project is a very simple chess board. It does not have an AI opponent, and it does not verify that moves made are legal, as this is just a portfolio
piece to showcase my skills in a concise, easy to read, single page project, and those features would bloat the code too much.

  -When you are prompted to select a piece, input into the command line the coordinates of the desired piece, starting with the horizontal coordinate. 
    -For example, if wanted to the left BLACK #ROOK#, you would input 07. 
  -When prompted for the location to move the selected piece, input the desired coordinates. 
  -Black pieces are denoted with '#' symbols on both sides of their name. White pieces aren't!
  -Pawns who reach the opposite side of the board are promoted to queens automatically
  -Known Bug: If you input a coordinate that does not correspond to a piece, the game will crash.
